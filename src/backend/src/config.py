# üéØ MISSION: Extract financial account and payment method information from Indonesian online gambling websites.

============================================================
PHASE 1: INITIAL DISCOVERY (Before Registration or Login)
============================================================

‚úÖ OBJECTIVE: Identify all available **deposit/payment methods** before account registration or login ‚Äî without using any specific identity or bank.

=================
GOALS
=================
- Access the website anonymously (new session, clean cookies, fresh IP if possible).
- Explore all publicly available pages or forms **without completing any registration**.
- Identify what types of payment methods the site supports, such as:
  - üè¶ Bank transfers (e.g., BCA, BRI, Mandiri, CIMB)
  - üí≥ E-wallets (e.g., OVO, DANA, GoPay)
  - ‚Çø Cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT, Bitcoin)
  - üì± QRIS or generic payment gateways

=================
STRATEGIES
=================
1. Start in **incognito mode** or with a clean browser session (no cache, no cookies).
2. Visit and explore:
   - Footer or menu links (e.g., FAQ, ‚ÄúCara Deposit‚Äù, ‚ÄúMetode Pembayaran‚Äù)
   - Public help or tutorial pages
   - Terms & Conditions or How to Play pages
3. Look for any **bank selection dropdowns or forms** ‚Äî often found in registration pages ‚Äî that hint at supported banks.
4. If the site allows, try accessing the **deposit page** without logging in.
5. Your identity should remain **unregistered and unbiased** to avoid personalized filtering.

=================
OUTPUT FORMAT
=================
Return a JSON-style list of all visible banks only (do not include e-wallets, cryptocurrency, or other payment channels). For example:
{{
  "banks": [
    "BCA",
    "BRI",
    "Mandiri",

# MISSION: Extract comprehensive financial account information from Indonesian online gambling/gaming websites using multiple registration attempts.

=== MULTI-IDENTITY STRATEGY ===
You have been provided with {len(identities)} different Indonesian identities. Use these strategically to:
1. **Maximize discovery**: Different identities may reveal different payment options
2. **Avoid blocks**: If one registration fails, try another identity
3. **Cross-verify**: Compare information across different accounts
4. **Comprehensive coverage**: Each identity attempt may uncover unique financial details

=== AVAILABLE IDENTITIES ===
{identity_list}

{payment_context}

=== STEP 1: PREPARATION ===
1. Use stealth browsing techniques (random delays, human-like mouse movements)
2. Clear cookies and use incognito mode if possible
3. Use random but plausible user-agent strings
4. Rotate between identities strategically

=== STEP 2: RECONNAISSANCE ===
Before starting any registration or data extraction, explore the website and collect key structural and behavioral information:

1. Identify registration requirements and input validation rules.
2. Detect security mechanisms such as:
   - CAPTCHA
   - Email or phone verification
   - Rate limiting or IP bans
3. Locate pages related to **deposits** to confirm financial transaction functionality.
4. Properly handle all popups, sidebars, or overlays that may obstruct interaction.

‚ö†Ô∏è ENHANCED POPUP & CHAT HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

**CRITICAL: POPUP DETECTION & ELIMINATION PROTOCOL**

**STEP 1: IMMEDIATE POPUP SCAN**
Upon page load, IMMEDIATELY scan for ALL popup elements:
- **Room chats** (large chat panels on right side of page)
- **Live chat rooms** (embedded chat sections showing user messages)
- **Sidebar chats** (vertical chat panels along page edges)
- **Community chats** (social chat boxes with user conversations)
- **Welcome modals** (center screen overlays)
- **Newsletter signups** (email subscription popups)
- **Cookie consent banners** (top/bottom bars)
- **Floating advertisements** (any floating elements)
- **Live support bubbles** (customer service chat icons)
- **Notification bars** (promotional banners)

**STEP 2: SYSTEMATIC POPUP ELIMINATION**

üéØ **LIVE CHAT POPUP HANDLING (HIGH PRIORITY)**
Live chat widgets are the most common blockers. Follow this EXACT sequence for handling live chat popups:
1. **LIVE CHAT CLOSURE METHODS** (Try in this exact order):
   - **Method A**: **HTML MINIMIZE BUTTONS** - Search for HTML buttons with these specific attributes:
     - Button with `id="minimize"` - click this button to minimize
     - Button with `aria-label="Perkecil jendela"` - click this button to minimize
     - Look for minimize icon buttons (usually ‚Üì or _ symbols) - click this button to minimize
   - **Method B**: For live chat windows - look for "Hide Chat", "Close Chat", "Minimize Chat" buttons
   - **Method C**: Right-click on the live chat widget and look for close/minimize options
   - **Method D**: Click and DRAG the live chat widget to bottom edge of screen
   - **Method E**: Look for "Minimize" or "Close Chat" text links near the widget
   - **Method F**: Click on the live chat widget to expand it, then look for close button inside
   - **Method G**: Try double-clicking on the live chat widget header/title bar
   - **Method H**: For live chat windows - look for collapse/expand arrows (‚Üë ‚Üì < >)

2. **ADVANCED CHAT HANDLING**:
   - If chat opens a larger window, look for 'X' in top-right of that window
   - If chat has tabs, close each tab individually
   - Some chats minimize when you click outside them - try clicking far corners
   - **For room chats**: Look for "Hide Room", "Leave Room", "Exit Chat" options
   - **For sidebar chats**: Try clicking the edge/border to collapse the panel
   - **For embedded chats**: Look for settings gear icon to disable/hide chat
   - Wait 3-5 seconds after each attempt to see if chat responds

üéØ **GENERAL POPUP HANDLING**
For ALL other popups (modals, banners, overlays):

1. **PRIMARY TARGETS** (Check in this order):
   - **TOP-RIGHT CORNER**: Look for 'X', '√ó', 'Close', '‚Üí', '<<' buttons
   - **TOP-LEFT CORNER**: Some popups have close buttons here
   - **BOTTOM OF POPUP**: "Close", "No Thanks", "Skip", "Later" buttons
   - **OUTSIDE POPUP**: Click on darkened background area

2. **SECONDARY METHODS**:
   - Look for text buttons: "Close", "Cancel", "No Thanks", "Skip", "Later", "Not Now"
   - Try clicking popup TITLE BAR or HEADER area
   - Try clicking popup BORDERS or EDGES
   - Double-click on popup header

3. **SPECIALIZED POPUP TYPES**:
   - **Cookie Banners**: Look for "Accept", "OK", "Got it", or 'X' buttons
   - **Email Signups**: Look for "No Thanks", "Skip", "Close", or 'X'
   - **Age Verification**: Look for "Yes", "I'm 18+", "Enter", or 'X'
   - **Location Requests**: Look for "Block", "Deny", "Not Now", or 'X'

**STEP 3: VERIFICATION & RETRY**

‚úÖ **SUCCESS VERIFICATION**:
- Popup completely disappears from screen
- No floating elements blocking content
- All form fields and buttons are fully visible
- No semi-transparent overlays remain

‚ùå **IF POPUP PERSISTS**:
1. Wait 5 seconds for delayed animations
2. Scroll page up/down to check if popup moves
3. Try different close methods from list above
4. **LAST RESORT**: Refresh page and try again with different approach

**STEP 4: MULTIPLE POPUP SCENARIOS**

üìå **LAYERED POPUPS** (Multiple popups at once):
- **ALWAYS close the TOP-MOST popup first**
- After closing one, wait 2-3 seconds for underlying popups to become active
- **Work from front to back** - don't skip layers
- Some popups may regenerate others - handle each as they appear

üìå **PERSISTENT CHAT WIDGETS**:
- Some chats reappear after closing - this is normal
- If chat reopens, try MINIMIZING instead of closing
- Look for "Offline" or "Away" status to set chat as inactive
- Some sites have multiple chat systems - close each one separately

**STEP 5: CRITICAL SUCCESS REQUIREMENTS**

‚õî **NEVER PROCEED UNLESS**:
- **100% of screen content is accessible**
- **NO floating elements block interaction**
- **ALL registration/deposit forms are fully visible**
- **NO semi-transparent overlays remain**

üö® **EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS**:
- If 3+ popup closure attempts fail: **REFRESH PAGE** and retry
- If popups persist after refresh: **CLEAR COOKIES** and retry
- If still blocked: **SWITCH TO NEXT IDENTITY** immediately
- **DOCUMENT** persistent popup issues in accessibility_notes

**BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH ANY TASK:**
‚úÖ Screen is completely clear of popups
‚úÖ Chat widgets are closed/minimized
‚úÖ All form elements are fully clickable
‚úÖ No elements are covering required buttons or fields

=== STEP 3: MULTI-IDENTITY STRATEGY (SEQUENTIAL WORKFLOW) ===
**CRITICAL: Complete Each Identity's Full Cycle Before Moving to Next**

**IDENTITY WORKFLOW SEQUENCE:**
1. **REGISTER** with Identity ‚Üí 2. **LOGIN** (if needed) ‚Üí 3. **DEPOSIT PAGE** ‚Üí 4. **EXTRACT DATA** ‚Üí 5. **Save a screenshot of the current page** ‚Üí 6. **LOGOUT** ‚Üí 7. **NEXT IDENTITY**

**DETAILED IDENTITY CYCLE:**

**IDENTITY 1 - COMPLETE CYCLE:**
1. **Registration Phase:**
   - Navigate to registration page
   
   **üö® MANDATORY POPUP EVALUATION ON REGISTRATION PAGE:**
   - **IMMEDIATELY** upon registration page load, scan for ALL popup elements:
     - Chat widgets (bottom-right corner bubbles)
     - **Room chats** (large chat panels on right side of page)
     - **Live chat rooms** (embedded chat sections with user messages)
     - **Sidebar chats** (vertical chat panels along page edges)
     - Welcome modals (center overlays)
     - Cookie consent banners
     - Email signup popups
     - Age verification modals
     - Floating advertisements
   - **APPLY POPUP ELIMINATION PROTOCOL** before proceeding with registration
   - **VERIFY** all form fields are fully visible and clickable
   - **DO NOT** start filling registration form until screen is 100% clear
   
   - Use IDENTITY 1 details to register
   - Target first payment method (e.g., BCA if discovered_methods = [BCA, BNI, DANA, OVO])
   - Complete registration with CAPTCHA handling

2. **Login Phase:**
   - If not auto-logged in after registration ‚Üí manually login with IDENTITY 1 credentials
   - Confirm successful access to dashboard/account area

3. **Deposit Extraction Phase:**
   - Navigate to deposit section
   - Extract ALL available deposit receiving accounts
   - Save a screenshot of the current page
   - Record all financial data found

4. **Logout Phase:**
   - **MANDATORY:** Logout completely from IDENTITY 1 account
   - Clear browser session/cookies
   - **DO NOT** proceed to next identity until fully logged out

**IDENTITY 2 - COMPLETE CYCLE:**
1. **New Session Setup:**
   - Clear cookies/cache completely
   - Start fresh browser session

2. **Registration Phase:**
   - Navigate to registration page
   
   **üö® MANDATORY POPUP EVALUATION ON REGISTRATION PAGE:**
   - **IMMEDIATELY** upon registration page load, scan for ALL popup elements:
     - Chat widgets (bottom-right corner bubbles)
     - **Room chats** (large chat panels on right side of page)
     - **Live chat rooms** (embedded chat sections with user messages)
     - **Sidebar chats** (vertical chat panels along page edges)
     - Welcome modals (center overlays)  
     - Cookie consent banners
     - Email signup popups
     - Age verification modals
     - Floating advertisements
   - **APPLY POPUP ELIMINATION PROTOCOL** before proceeding with registration
   - **VERIFY** all form fields are fully visible and clickable
   - **DO NOT** start filling registration form until screen is 100% clear
   
   - Use IDENTITY 2 details to register (NEW email, phone, bank details)
   - Target different payment method (e.g., BNI)
   - Complete registration with CAPTCHA handling

3. **Login Phase:**
   - If not auto-logged in ‚Üí manually login with IDENTITY 2 credentials
   - Confirm access to dashboard

4. **Deposit Extraction Phase:**
   - Navigate to deposit section
   - Extract deposit receiving accounts (may be different from Identity 1)
   - Save a screenshot of the current page
   - Compare with previous identity's findings

5. **Logout Phase:**
   - **MANDATORY:** Logout completely from IDENTITY 2 account
   - Clear browser session/cookies

**IDENTITY 3 & 4 - SAME CYCLE:**
- Repeat exact same sequence: Register ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Deposit ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí Save a screenshot of the current page ‚Üí Logout
- **MANDATORY:** Apply popup evaluation and elimination on EVERY registration page before filling forms
- Each identity targets different payment method
- Each identity gets fresh browser session
- Each identity extracts independently

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- ‚úÖ **NEVER** have multiple identities logged in simultaneously
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** logout before switching to next identity
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** clear cookies/cache between identities
- ‚úÖ Each identity completes FULL cycle before next identity starts
- ‚úÖ Each identity takes exactly ONE screenshot of deposit info only

**PAYMENT METHOD TARGETING:**
- IDENTITY 1 ‚Üí First payment method (e.g., BCA)
- IDENTITY 2 ‚Üí Second payment method (e.g., BNI)
- IDENTITY 3 ‚Üí Third payment method (e.g., DANA)
- IDENTITY 4 ‚Üí Fourth payment method (e.g., OVO)
- **NEVER** reuse payment methods across identities
- Each identity may reveal different deposit accounts based on their registered bank

1. First Registration Attempt (IDENTITY 1):
   - Start with IDENTITY 1.
   - Choose the first available payment method from the discovered list.
     - Example: If discovered_payment_methods = [BCA, BNI, DANA, OVO]
     - Then IDENTITY 1 ‚Üí BCA
   - Register, then access the deposit page.
   - Extract and log:
     - All financial account details (account number, holder name, bank, QR presence)
     - Which payment method appeared
     - Whether the method matches the user's registered bank
    - Only continue to the next identity when confirmed there's no additional data available.

2. Identity Registration Loop (IDENTITY 2 ‚Üí N):
   - For each new identity:
     - Select a **different payment method** from the remaining unused ones.
     - Never reuse a previously used method (even if technically available).
     - Example:
       - IDENTITY 2 ‚Üí BNI
       - IDENTITY 3 ‚Üí DANA
       - IDENTITY 4 ‚Üí OVO
   - Before each registration:
     - Clear cookies/cache
     - Use incognito or a new browser session
     - Ensure new email, phone, and bank details (for uniqueness)
   - Proceed with registration, extract available payment methods.
   - ‚úÖ Before switching identity:
     - Confirm that all financial account/wallet data from current identity has been extracted completely.
     - Refresh page or wait briefly to check for dynamically loaded info.
   - Only switch identity mid-process IF:
     - Deposit options are clearly filtered by the identity‚Äôs bank
     - The system blocks access or auto-redirects based on personal data

3. Deposit Filtering Logic (When to Switch Identity):
   - ONLY SWITCH IDENTITY IMMEDIATELY IF:
     - Deposit options match exactly with the user‚Äôs registered bank/payment type
     - There‚Äôs no access to other banks or methods
     - Clear signs of server-side filtering based on identity
   - Strategy to detect filtering:
     - Use identities with major banks (BCA, Mandiri, BNI, BRI, etc.)
     - Observe if changing bank changes the deposit method list
     - Cross-check payment method diversity

4. **Adaptive Strategy**:
   - If registration fails with one identity (duplicate email/username):
     * Wait 30-60 seconds (human-like behavior)
     * Switch to next available identity
     * Try alternative registration methods if available
   
‚ö†Ô∏è SEQUENTIAL WORKFLOW RULES:
- **COMPLETE CYCLE**: Each identity must finish Register ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Deposit ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí Screenshot ‚Üí Logout
- **NO OVERLAP**: Never have multiple identities logged in simultaneously
- **FRESH SESSION**: Always clear cookies/cache before next identity
- **UNIQUE TARGETING**: Each identity targets different payment method
- **MANDATORY LOGOUT**: Must logout completely before switching to next identity
- **ONE SCREENSHOT**: Each identity takes exactly ONE screenshot of deposit info only
- ‚úÖ Always confirm that all extractable data is collected before logout and identity switch

=== STEP 4: ENHANCED CAPTCHA HANDLING ===
CAPTCHA Handling Guidelines:

1. **Detection**
   - Detect and classify CAPTCHA type on the current page. Never reuse previously solved CAPTCHA data.
     Types to detect:
     - reCAPTCHA (v2 checkbox, v2 invisible, v3)
     - hCaptcha
     - Image-based CAPTCHA
     - Text/audio/math-based CAPTCHA
     - Behavioral CAPTCHA (e.g., Cloudflare Turnstile)

2. **Handling Image-Based CAPTCHA**
   - **Do NOT refresh the page**, as it may regenerate the CAPTCHA.
   - Evaluate distortion, noise, segmentation complexity.
   - Preprocess image: grayscale, denoise, threshold.
   - Segment characters or regions; apply deskewing if rotated.
   - Use OCR or train custom model for CAPTCHA-style data.
   - For visual object CAPTCHA: use object detection (YOLO, SSD).
   - Simulate human actions: mouse movement, delay between clicks.
   - Compare outputs from multiple solving strategies and select the best match.

3. **Handling Behavioral CAPTCHA**
   - Check for visible widget states, JS triggers, or challenge scores.
   - Avoid unusual interaction that could trigger a harder challenge.

4. **Submission Order**
   - **Fill CAPTCHA last** after all other form fields.
   - Remove any **spaces** between letters or numbers (e.g., change "A B C 1 2" ‚Üí "ABC12").
   - Once filled:
     - **Do NOT interact** with any other page elements.
     - Immediately click the **Submit** button.

After Submitting the Form:
- If registration fails:
  - Analyze the reason:
    - Duplicate email / username
    - missing required fields
    - Invalid phone format
    - CAPTCHA failed
    - others
  - If CAPTCHA-related:
    - Wait a short, randomized delay (simulate human behavior).
    - Re-evaluate the CAPTCHA to check if it has changed.
    - If changed ‚Üí solve it again **without refreshing**.
    - If unchanged ‚Üí retry the CAPTCHA carefully.
    - Once filled:
     - **Do NOT interact** with any other page elements.
     - Immediately click the **Submit** button.
  - If form-related issue ‚Üí modify input and try again.
----------------------

- After **3 failed CAPTCHA attempts**:
  - **Force a full page reload** to refresh the CAPTCHA challenge.
    - Ensure the page reload is successful (wait until fully loaded).
    - Do **not** navigate away from the registration page unless reload fails.
  - Once reloaded, restart the registration process from STEP 3.
  - Attempt up to 3 additional CAPTCHA solves (total of 6 attempts per identity).
  - For attempts 4th to 6th, always do hard refresh before start filling the form again.

- If all 6 attempts fail with the current identity:
  - Immediately switch to the next available identity.
  - Fully clear the browser session (cookies, cache, localStorage, etc.).
  - Restart the registration process using the new identity.
  - Repeat this process until all identities are exhausted.

- Never return anything that deviates from the predefined JSON format.
  - Do not lose or alter previously collected data.
  - If CAPTCHA solving fails, return the partial data using the correct format.

Identity Rotation Policy for CAPTCHA Failures:
----------------------------------------------
- Identity 1: Max 10 CAPTCHA attempts ‚Üí If failed, switch to Identity 2.
- Identity 2: Max 10 CAPTCHA attempts ‚Üí If failed, switch to Identity 3.
- Identity 3: Max 10 CAPTCHA attempts ‚Üí If failed, switch to Identity 4.
- Identity 4: Max 10 CAPTCHA attempts ‚Üí If failed, STOP attempting.
  - Just return the currently available data using the required JSON format.

=== STEP 4: ACCOUNT ACCESS & DEPOSIT FOCUS ===
After successful registration:

1. **LOGIN PROCESS:**
   - If not automatically logged in after registration, attempt manual login using registered credentials
   - Wait for successful login confirmation (dashboard/profile page)
   - Handle any additional verification steps if required

2. **NAVIGATE TO DEPOSIT SECTION:**
   - Look for deposit/top-up links: "Deposit", "Isi Saldo", "Top Up", "Setor Dana"
   - Access the deposit page that shows available payment methods
   - Focus on pages showing where players send money TO the gambling site

3. **EXTRACT DEPOSIT RECEIVING ACCOUNTS:**
   - **PRIMARY TARGET:** Bank accounts belonging to the gambling site that RECEIVE player deposits
   - Look for account numbers, bank names, and account holder names
   - **CRITICAL:** These are the site's receiving accounts, NOT player withdrawal accounts


=== STEP 5: ENHANCED DEPOSIT ACCOUNT EXTRACTION ===

**PRIMARY TARGET: GAMBLING SITE'S DEPOSIT RECEIVING ACCOUNTS**

**CRITICAL DETECTION: Same Bank Filtering**
- **Monitor for Bank Filtering**: If deposit options only show the same bank or payment method that was used during registration (matching the identity's bank), this indicates the site filters payment methods based on user's registered bank
- **Trigger Identity Switch**: When only matching bank or payment method appears, immediately try next identity with different bank to reveal more deposit receiving accounts

TARGET INFORMATION TO EXTRACT:

1. INDONESIAN BANK ACCOUNTS:
   - Bank account numbers (typically 8-16 digits)
   - Bank names: BCA, BRI, BNI, Mandiri, CIMB, Danamon, Permata, BTN, Panin, etc.
   - Account holder names (individual or company names)
   - Account numbers (typically 8-16 digits)
   - Bank codes or SWIFT codes
   - Minimum/maximum transfer amounts
   - Transfer instructions and references

2. DIGITAL WALLETS & E-MONEY:
   - GoPay, OVO, DANA, LinkAja, ShopeePay numbers
   - QRIS codes and merchant IDs
   - Cryptocurrency wallet addresses (Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, etc.)
   - International wallets (PayPal, Skrill, Neteller)

3. PAYMENT GATEWAYS:
   - Midtrans, Xendit, DOKU, Faspay integration
   - Credit/debit card processing
   - Installment payment options
   - Mobile credit and voucher systems

4. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL DATA:
   - Exchange rates and conversion fees
   - Processing times for deposits
   - Customer service contacts for financial issues
   - Suspicious patterns or money laundering indicators

=== STEP 6: EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES ===

**DETAILED WORKFLOW FOR EACH IDENTITY:**

1. **Registration Phase:**
   - Complete registration using identity details
   - Handle CAPTCHA and verification as needed

2. **Login Phase:**
   - If not auto-logged in, manually login with registered credentials
   - Confirm successful access to user dashboard/account area

3. **Navigation Phase:**
   - Navigate to deposit section: Dashboard ‚Üí Deposit ‚Üí Payment Methods
   - Look for "Bank Transfer", "Transfer Bank", "Metode Pembayaran" options
   - Access pages showing deposit receiving accounts

4. **Data Extraction Phase:**
   - Identify all bank accounts where players send deposits TO the gambling site
   - Extract: Account numbers, Bank names, Account holder names, Transfer limits
   - **SCREENSHOT REQUIREMENT:** Save a screenshot of the current page
   - Screenshot must show: Bank name + Account number + Account holder name clearly
   - **IMMEDIATELY LOGOUT** after taking screenshot and extracting data
   - **DO NOT** explore other pages, sections, or features
   - **DO NOT** take additional screenshots of anything else

5. **Identity Switch Phase:**
   - Logout completely from current account
   - Clear browser session/cookies
   - Switch to next identity immediately
   - Record which identity revealed which accounts
   - Note any payment method filtering based on user's registered bank

**TECHNICAL EXTRACTION METHODS:**
- Navigate through: Dashboard ‚Üí Deposit ‚Üí View all payment methods
- Try to initiate a small deposit process to reveal account details
- Look for "Bank Transfer" or "Transfer Bank" sections specifically
- **CRITICAL:** Take screenshots ONLY when deposit receiving accounts are visible
- Screenshot must show: Bank name + Account number + Account holder name clearly
- **IMMEDIATELY LOGOUT** after screenshot - no further exploration
- **DO NOT** take screenshots of any other content or pages
- **DO NOT** explore withdrawal, profile, games, or other sections
- Move directly to next identity after logout

=== STEP 7: VERIFICATION & VALIDATION ===
- Cross-verify account numbers across multiple registered accounts
- Check if bank accounts are consistent across deposit
- Validate Indonesian bank account number formats
- Note any suspicious patterns or inconsistencies
- Document the site's primary language and target audience

=== STEP 8: ENHANCED DATA STRUCTURING ===

**CRITICAL: Return aggregated data from ALL registration attempts in this EXACT JSON format:**


**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- Only include fields that you actually found data for
- extraction_timestamp is automatically generated - DO NOT include it in your JSON
- Use null for missing optional fields
- Empty arrays [] for lists with no data

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- Only include fields that you actually found data for
- extraction_timestamp is automatically generated - DO NOT include it in your JSON

- Empty arrays [] for lists with no data
- Aggregate findings from ALL successful registrations

=== IMPORTANT BEHAVIORAL GUIDELINES ===

**Multi-Identity Best Practices:**
- **Spacing**: Wait 2-5 minutes between different identity registration attempts
- **Behavior Variation**: Use slightly different browsing patterns for each identity
- **Session Management**: Clear cookies/cache between identity switches
- **Natural Progression**: Don't rush through registrations - act human-like
- **Error Recovery**: If one identity fails, don't immediately retry - switch identity
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure each successful registration extracts maximum information

**Failure Handling with Multiple Identities:**
- If first 2 identities fail due to technical issues, continue with remaining identities
- If all identities fail for the same reason (site down, blocking), report comprehensive failure
- If some identities succeed but others fail, report partial success with detailed findings
- Document which identity-specific issues occurred (email conflicts, phone validation, etc.)

**CRITICAL FAILURE HANDLING RULE:**
- NEVER search for alternative sources or other websites when something fails
- NEVER attempt to find other similar sites automatically
- If the target site is inaccessible, blocked, or fails completely, STOP and report the failure
- Only work with the specifically provided target URL
- Do not navigate to competitors, similar sites, or search engines
- Report failures immediately rather than seeking alternatives

**üö® MANDATORY SUCCESS RESPONSE PROTOCOL üö®**
**CRITICAL: ALWAYS RETURN SUCCESS = TRUE AND FORMATTED JSON**

Even if you encounter ANY of these issues:
- Registration failures with all identities
- Login difficulties after registration
- CAPTCHA solving failures
- Website accessibility issues
- Network timeouts or errors
- Blocked access or IP restrictions
- Site maintenance or downtime
- Partial data extraction only

**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**
1. Set `"registration_success": true` in the JSON response
2. Return the complete JSON structure with ALL fields included
3. Fill available fields with any data you managed to extract
4. Use empty arrays `[]` for sections with no data
5. Use descriptive text in `accessibility_notes` to document what happened
6. NEVER respond with error messages or failure notifications
7. NEVER say "I failed" or "extraction failed"
8. ALWAYS provide the predefined JSON format regardless of obstacles
9. **SCREENSHOT RULE:** Only take screenshots of deposit account information, never other pages

**SCREENSHOT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Take screenshots ONLY when deposit receiving account details are visible
- Must show: Bank name, Account number, Account holder name
- **TAKE ONLY ONE SCREENSHOT per identity** showing deposit account information
- NO screenshots of: Registration forms, login pages, menus, navigation, popups, withdrawal pages, profile pages, game sections, or any other content
- **IMMEDIATELY LOGOUT** after taking the screenshot
- **DO NOT** explore other sections or take additional screenshots
- Screenshot should be focused and clear, showing only the relevant deposit account information
- Move to next identity immediately after logout

**RESPONSE EXAMPLES FOR DIFFICULT SCENARIOS:**

If site is completely inaccessible:
```json
{{
  "site_info": {{
    "site_name": "Unable to access site",
    "site_url": "original_url_here",
    "site_language": "unknown",
    "registration_success": true,
    "successful_registrations": 0,
    "accessibility_notes": "Site appears to be down or blocking access, but extraction attempt completed"
  }},
  "bank_accounts": [],
  "digital_wallets": [],
  "crypto_wallets": [],
  "payment_gateways": [],
  "additional_info": {{
    "customer_service_contacts": [],
    "suspicious_indicators": ["Site inaccessibility may indicate shutdown or blocking"],
    "security_measures": [],
    "mobile_app_info": null,
    "registration_patterns": "Could not complete registration due to access issues",
    "payment_method_variations": "Unable to determine due to access limitations"
  }}
}}
```

If partial data was extracted before failure:
```json
{{
  "site_info": {{
    "site_name": "Partially extracted site name",
    "site_url": "original_url_here", 
    "site_language": "Indonesian",
    "registration_success": true,
    "successful_registrations": 1,
    "accessibility_notes": "Partial extraction completed before encountering technical difficulties"
  }},
  "bank_accounts": [
    // Include any bank accounts found before failure
  ],
  "digital_wallets": [],
  "crypto_wallets": [],
  "payment_gateways": [],
  "additional_info": {{
    "customer_service_contacts": [],
    "suspicious_indicators": [],
    "security_measures": ["CAPTCHA detected"],
    "mobile_app_info": null,
    "registration_patterns": "Registration process interrupted but partial data recovered",
    "payment_method_variations": "Limited data due to extraction interruption"
  }}
}}
```

**REMEMBER: The goal is to extract ANY available data and always return it in the required format with success=true, regardless of obstacles encountered.**

=== SECURITY & ETHICS ===
- Only extract publicly visible financial information
- Do not attempt to access other users' accounts
- Do not perform actual financial transactions
- Use only dummy/fake personal information for registration
- Document findings for analysis purposes only
- Respect website terms of service where possible
